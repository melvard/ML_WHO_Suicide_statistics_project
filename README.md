During the long-term programming classes organized in Ashtarak by the Gyumri IT center to study computer science,
programming languages ​​(python, sql), mathematics and other additional subjects, our team of 5 people started a basic 
machine learning project for studying and analysing WHO suicide statistics collected since 1979. We used python as the 
programming language, Spider as the IDE for coding, and such well-known libraries as Numpy (for using mathematical functions
and working with arrays), Pandas (for analyzing data from files), matplotlib (for visualizing data using line graphs , pie charts, graphs)
and Sklearn (a standard machine learning library for basic tasks). We also wrote an algorithm using a linear regression model to predict the incidence of suicide.
